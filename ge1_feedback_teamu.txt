TEAM U

METADATA

Does the document clearly identify team ID, member names
and contact details?

> team id and names clear at top of first page.
> However no contact details given.

Does the document have a version number or date?


> Date given. Also consider using a version number. 
> (There are LaTeX packages to incorporate version control
> metadata directly into your built dvi/pdf files.)

Does the document clearly state its purpose?

> title is clear. However a brief abstract or 'Document Objectives'
> section at the start might be very helpful.

GENERAL FORMATTING

Is the document neatly laid out?

> yes. Well formatted and clear to read.
> Commendation for using LaTeX.

Is the document relatively free of grammatical and 
typographic errors?

> yes. good.

Are the various sections clearly labelled?

> Yes, each section has a clear label and a number. Excellent.

TEAM ORGANIZATION

Is the proposed team organization clearly presented?

> Proposed to use Agile scrum approach.

Is it justified in a reasonable manner?

> Yes - clear justification in sect 1. Great.

ROLES

Are the roles appropriate?

> yes, scrum roles all appropriate.

Is each role clearly explained?

> Yes, description of tasks for each role is given.
> good.

ASSIGNMENT

Is there a reasonable basis for each role/person assignment?

> Excellent justification for why each team member has been
> assigned to particular roles. Great! Drawing on experience
> and previous study. Well done.
> No-one is assigned to customer representative - this will
> be necessary.


COMMUNICATION

Is there at least one synchronous comms channel?

> no. All the online collaborative tools you mentioned
> appear to be asynchronous? Or can Asana be used
> synchronously? Does it have a chat facility?

Is there at least one asynchronous comms channel?

> yes. Note it might be worth ordering the priority of your
> comms channels, so team members know which channel to use
> for which purposes - some of them are only fallbacks perhaps.

Will the team meet at least once per week?

> no mention of face to face meetings (except for passing
> reference in scrum master role description). This should
> be an important part of your comms strategy. Mention
> frequency of f2f meetings, and location.

Have the team planned to capture a record of comms?

> You talk about the Asana system. Is this how you will record
> minutes of meetings, important discussions and decisions? Also
> Actions Arising? Be explicit about this.

How will the team re-establish contact with absent/unreliable
members?

> No clear strategy of how to deal with this. You need a protocol
> for getting in touch with 'missing' members.

RISKS

Does the team have reasonable avoidance strategy for conflict?

> democracy followed by compromise. Probably ok. Other
> options you mention might be asking your team supervisor to mediate,
> (good idea) or
> having a 'cooling off' period. Or let one team member with more
> experience have the 'deciding vote'.

Mitigation strategy for conflict?

> See above.

Mitigation strategy for team member dropout?

> Yes, workload redistribution - good. Possibly have each member
> buddy up with one other member - to understand that person's roles
> and tasks fully, in case that person leaves the team.

Mitigation strategy for team member addition?

> nothing stated on this. It might happen!

Any other risks identified?

No.


GENERAL COMMENTS


A well structured and detailed account. Great description of Scrum.
Some more work needed on comms strategy - 
Please address the comments above, and revise your
team organization document as the semester continues.
Final version due in end-of-semester portfolio.
