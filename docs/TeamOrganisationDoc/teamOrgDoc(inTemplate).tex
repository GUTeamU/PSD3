\section{Proposed Team Organisation Model}
\noindent The team is proposing to use the SCRUM approach which is a part of the Agile
software development framework.   The use of the scrum method is suitable as it
is the most flexible of the options. Having this flexibility is really useful
as it allows each team member to contribute to different parts of the
development process and work towards their strengths.


\noindent The incremental development methods associated with agile methods are also
essential due to the importance of performing unit tests on each increment
before they can be integrated with the rest of the system, to ensure the
production of a high quality end result.


\noindent The agile model is particularly attractive as it allows all members to work
towards a common goal, rather than being tied down to traditional sequential
methods. Verbal communication between all team members is a must in order to
maintain organisation and ensure members are informed and aware of what the
others are doing. Dealing with changing requirements is another important
aspect of the model, as the team must be able to efficiently adapt to any
emerging needs of the client. 

\section{Description of the Roles within the Team}
\subsection*{Scrum Master}
\noindent A scrum master will arrange and lead regular group meetings and discussions.
He/she will discuss with the team at these sessions daily progress and any
problems encountered during recent tasks. If problems are discovered, the scrum
master will find the appropriate tools or personnel among the team to overcome
these difficulties.
\subsection*{Developers}
\noindent A developer within a team will contribute to the identification, analysis and
implementation of each task assigned to the project. This will allow the
project to be completed efficiently and effectively, resulting in high quality
software products being produced. 
\subsection*{Client Representative}
\noindent A client representative will be embeded into the development team in order to 
ensure that client's requirements are met and to help answer any questions that 
the developers might have regarding the project outside of the scheduled meetings
with the client.

\section{Assignment of Team Members to Role}
\subsection*{Fraser Leishman -- Scrum Master}
\noindent Fraser has good organisational skills and excellent communicational skills
through his part time work, dealing with the public, in John Lewis. There he
has learned to work well as part of a team and can apply these skills to any
team based development projects he will face in the future.

\subsection*{Michael Cromie -- Developer}
\noindent Michael has a firm grasp of software development techniques due to his work
experience at the tech company Atos, where he observed experienced programmers
as they worked on professional software for the NHS. This will stand him in
very good stead to go on and aid the team in developing high quality software,
as he knows how a professional software house operates on a daily basis, which
he can bring to the group.

\subsection*{Andrew McDonald -- Developer}
\noindent Due to his first two years studying electrical engineering at the University of
Glasgow, Andrew is very technically minded. He has a very hands on approach,
which when brought to the team will help solve any technicalities faced on the
development path. Andrew will also be a key member in projects involving
electronics or robotics.

\subsection*{Matthew Paterson -- Developer}
\noindent Matthew is a problem solver. He has strong mathematical interests along with a
passion for algorithms, which will allow him to furtherly break down and
analyse tasks. This theoretical approach to the development process will allow
the team to foresee potential miscalculations and avoid them in due course. 

\subsection*{Edvin Malinovskis -- Developer}
\noindent Edvin is an experienced developer and a key member of the team. He can program
in several languages and has had experience as a freelance developer,
completing numerous real-world software products. Edvin has a very software
based mindset which will make him central to the development of high quality
software. 

\section{Communication Strategies}
\noindent We will have weekly team meetings in the SAWB level 2 where we will discuss progress to date, and aims for the near future. We will set an agenda and keep a note of the minutes from these meetings on paper, which one of us will then type up and upload these minutes to Asana - where we will keep them organised. 

\noindent Our main strategy for organisation is to use Asana, a web and mobile
application designed to improve the way teams communicate and collaborate, as a
metaphorical virtual whiteboard we can rally around. We compared other project
management software, such as Trello, however we settled on Asana as we
preferred the user interface.

\noindent We will also be using the version control software Git in order to share and
coordinate the production of our software solution. This will be hosted on the
University allocated server space once it becomes available; whilst also being
backed up to a GitHub repository.

\noindent Our main method of asynchronous communication is via personal email. We send regular team updates to our personal email addresses, as opposed to our University email accounts - which will be checked more frequently and in some cases almost instantly via smartphone.

\noindent Another method of asynchronous communication is our Facebook group. We have set up a Facebook group to post the slightly less major, less formal issues.

\noindent Our main method of synchronous communication is to use the chat facility in Google Hangouts. This allows us to participate in group chat, and is available on both mobile format (via iOS and Android apps) and web-based (via a browser). It also allows us to have multi person video call, which is a feature we haven't really employed.

\noindent Other methods of synchronous communication are via our Facebook group and we also utilise the chat facility for synchronous communication inbuilt into Google Documents if we are collaboratively working on a document at that time.

\noindent We have also swapped mobile numbers in case any team member can't get in contact of another via the above methods of communication, or require very fast contact with an individual team member in the case of a minor emergency.

\section{Organisational Risks}
\noindent If someone was to leave the team, the other four members would carry on with
any on going projects. The other members would take over the leavers role in
the team, meaning the task could go on. This would be possible due to the agile
organisation model and thorough communication strategies, which means all team
members can be flexible in their roles and well informed as to the progress
being made on other tasks.

\noindent If an additional member were to join our team, we would find this new member an appropriate role in the team and continue development as normal, including the new member in our new, larger, team.

\noindent If, at any point, there is an argument between team members on certain issues,
such as how to approach tasks, we are likely going to try and solve the issue
within the group and get the views of the other members and vote democratically
on who has the better idea/correct vision of what is to be done. Potentially, a
compromise could also be available which would hopefully appease the members of
the group who were arguing.

\noindent However, as a group, we could also bring the issue to the attention our
supervisor, he would give impartial advice on the issue which we would then
take away to debate amongst ourselves.
