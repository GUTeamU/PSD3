'''Team U Risk Assessment Document'''


== Description of Severities ==
##40cc1f## Low ## - Something of inconvenience, relatively easy to overcome. These issues should be easily rectified and the overall project shouldn't be affected.

#f69006## Moderate ## - A slightly problematic issue, something that may take some time or resources to overcome. In some cases these problems may affect the end product, but not significantly.

##FF0000## Severe ## - These problems will be very difficult to overcome, sometimes costing a great deal of time or money. Severe issues will almost definitely delay the project or at least lessen the quality of overall software. 




||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.1''' ||
||= Category =|| Requirements ||	
||= Description =|| We opt to do a demonstration that is too difficult or physically impossible for us to get the robot to perform ||
||= Probability =|| Low-Medium ||
||= Impact =|| Reduces the quality of the final product, which is the demonstration and project ||
||= Severity =|| Moderate (the portion of credits awarded to the Software design, implementation, and documentation of the product is 0.4 credits) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Discuss complication versus spectacle  balance with team supervisor, adjust as necessary ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.2''' ||
||= Category =|| Skills ||	
||= Description =|| Programming the Robot Operating System proves too difficult for one or more of our team members ||
||= Probability =|| Medium ||
||= Impact =|| Reduces effectiveness of team in complete the desired tasks ||
||= Severity =|| Low (other team members can pick up the slack and help out the team members having difficulty) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Discuss with each team member how well their grasp of the R.O.S is ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.3''' ||
||= Category =|| Technical ||	
||= Description =|| A bug in our design or in the R.O.S causes for the robot to go out of control ||
||= Probability =|| Very Low ||
||= Impact =|| Possible damage to the robot and robot housing infrastructure (Boyd Orr Building). Possible human cost ||
||= Severity =|| Severe (this would hinder the progress of our project should the damages be irreparable ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Thoroughly test software using simulation to ensure it behaves as expected ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.4''' ||
||= Category =|| Planning ||	
||= Description =|| We spend a disproportionate amount of time on planning stage and donâ€™t leave enough for the implementation ||
||= Probability =|| Medium-High ||
||= Impact =|| Leaves not enough time to implement the demonstration and so the quality of the final product suffers ||
||= Severity =|| Moderate (the portion of credits awarded to the Software design, implementation, and documentation of the product is 0.4 credits) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Discuss work balance with team supervisor, adjust as necessary ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.5''' ||
||= Category =|| Political ||	
||= Description =|| Team members do not work efficiently together ||
||= Probability =|| Medium ||
||= Impact =|| Lack of understanding and coherence between team members causing incomplete work and poor team moral ||
||= Severity =|| Low - Moderate (Working together for several months and a breakdown in communications will result in the quality of the final product suffering) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Regular face-to-face meetings to establish what each team member is working on and how their work will integrate with the rest of the project ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.6''' ||
||= Category =|| Political ||	
||= Description =|| A student from another team is introduced into our team ||
||= Probability =|| Low-Medium ||
||= Impact =|| Time spent overcoming personnel changes puts the team off track of the time plan and delays the end product ||
||= Severity =|| Low (The team would be able to re-allocate roles to include the new member) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| The agile model allows team positions to be easily swapped mid way through a project, making this problem less of an issue ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.7''' ||
||= Category =|| Political ||	
||= Description =|| A student leaves our team ||
||= Probability =|| Low ||
||= Impact =|| The increased workload on each remaining member of the team slows down the overall process and delays the end product ||
||= Severity =|| Moderate ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| The agile model allows team positions to be easily swapped mid way through a project, making this problem less of an issue ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.8''' ||
||= Category =|| Planning ||	
||= Description =|| Lack of formality in the scheduling of tasks ||
||= Probability =|| Medium-High(Due to Agile model ||
||= Impact =|| Failure to adhere to deadlines of tasks and work packages due to a lack of strict timetabling and enforced deadlines ||
||= Severity =|| Low - Moderate (Deadlines missed causing a backlog of work which would need to be addressed) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Maintain order at all stages of the development process using various tools to aid in the management and organisation of tasks, e.g. Asana. ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.9''' ||
||= Category =|| Technical ||	
||= Description =|| Outside parties having access to the robot ||
||= Probability =|| Medium ||
||= Impact =|| As other people are working with the robot in parallel with our project, the team is not in complete control over the functionality and overall condition of the robot ||
||= Severity =|| Moderate (Robot could could be damaged or altered in a way that could affect and the scope and hence overall quality of the final product) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| Identify and keep in regular contact with the other parties to discuss any issues that may have arisen while they were interacting with the robot/system ||
[[BR]]
||= '''Risk Id''' =|| '''R.10''' ||
||= Category =|| Political ||	
||= Description =|| The customer changes the project specification mid-way into the project ||
||= Probability =|| Low ||
||= Impact =|| Depending on severity, overall progress may have to be undone and restarted ||
||= Severity =|| Moderate (re-doing considerable amounts of work could delay the project) ||
||= Status =|| Identified ||
||= Controls =|| The customer representative will work closely with the customer ||
